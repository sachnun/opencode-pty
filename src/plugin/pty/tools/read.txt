Reads output from a PTY session's buffer.

The PTY maintains a rolling buffer of output lines. Use offset and limit to paginate through the output, similar to reading a file.

Usage:
- `id`: The PTY session ID (from pty_spawn or pty_list)
- `offset`: Line number to start reading from (0-based, defaults to 0)
- `limit`: Number of lines to read (defaults to 500)
- `pattern`: Regex pattern to filter lines (optional)
- `ignoreCase`: Case-insensitive pattern matching (default: false)

Returns:
- Numbered lines of output (similar to cat -n format)
- Total line count in the buffer
- Indicator if more lines are available

The buffer stores up to PTY_MAX_BUFFER_LINES (default: 50000) lines. Older lines are discarded when the limit is reached.

Pattern Filtering:
- When `pattern` is set, lines are FILTERED FIRST using the regex, then offset/limit apply to the MATCHES
- Original line numbers are preserved so you can see where matches occurred in the buffer
- Supports full regex syntax (e.g., "error", "ERROR|WARN", "failed.*connection", etc.)
- If the pattern is invalid, an error message is returned explaining the issue
- If no lines match the pattern, a clear message indicates zero matches

Tips:
- To see the latest output, use a high offset or omit offset to read from the start
- To tail recent output, calculate offset as (totalLines - N) where N is how many recent lines you want
- Lines longer than 2000 characters are truncated
- Empty output may mean the process hasn't produced output yet

Examples:
- Read first 100 lines: offset=0, limit=100
- Read lines 500-600: offset=500, limit=100
- Read all available: omit both parameters
- Find errors: pattern="error", ignoreCase=true
- Find specific log levels: pattern="ERROR|WARN|FATAL"
- First 10 matches only: pattern="error", limit=10
