Spawns a new interactive PTY (pseudo-terminal) session that runs in the background.

Unlike the built-in bash tool which runs commands synchronously and waits for completion, PTY sessions persist and allow you to:
- Run long-running processes (dev servers, watch modes, etc.)
- Send interactive input (including Ctrl+C, arrow keys, etc.)
- Read output at any time
- Manage multiple concurrent terminal sessions

Usage:
- The `command` parameter is required (e.g., "npm", "python", "bash")
- Use `args` to pass arguments to the command (e.g., ["run", "dev"])
- Use `workdir` to set the working directory (defaults to project root)
- Use `env` to set additional environment variables
- Use `title` to give the session a human-readable name
- The `description` parameter is required: a clear, concise 5-10 word description

Returns the session info including:
- `id`: Unique identifier (pty_XXXXXXXX) for use with other pty_* tools
- `pid`: Process ID
- `status`: Current status ("running")

After spawning, use:
- `pty_write` to send input to the PTY
- `pty_read` to read output from the PTY
- `pty_list` to see all active PTY sessions
- `pty_kill` to terminate the PTY

Examples:
- Start a dev server: command="npm", args=["run", "dev"], title="Dev Server"
- Start a Python REPL: command="python3", title="Python REPL"
- Run tests in watch mode: command="npm", args=["test", "--", "--watch"]
